# Modular Interfaces Manifesto
##### v1.2 – (Portuguese version [here](manifesto-PT-BR.md)).

We are designers and developers.

We don't create *comps* for sites, applications and digital products. We don't deliver *pixel perfect* solutions.

We build **modular systems**: flexible and scalable interfaces, composed of reusable elements.

We seek ways to break the barriers between responsibilities on an interface project.

We stimulate creative autonomy for developers and continuous participation for designers during the entire project.

We promote collaboration between clients, developers, designers and users.

We want to foment and further the discussions on digital interface creation and development on the communities we participate.

We follow these principles:

> ### "Ugly" first

> Every project begins "ugly", because we believe that the initial conversations should be about content, navigation flows and structure – not visual details.

> ### Gradual improvement

> The project will be constantly evolving. Refinement will happen in agile cycles, prioritizing what generates the higher value. Expanding from smaller to bigger (*mobile-first* approach) and from the inside to the outside (*content-first* approach).

> ### Look and feel over pixel perfection

> Design guidelines will serve as foundation, guiding the path for development. Therefore, interface decisions should be taken based on the final output – code in the browser –, not the graphic design tool.

>### System-thinking

> The interfaces will result from the combination of modular elements, built to maintain visual and functional consistency.
