# Modular Interfaces Manifesto
#### v.0.1
#### (Portuguese version [here](manifesto-ptBR.md))

We are designers and developers.

We don't create *comps* for sites, applications and digital products. We don't deliver *pixel perfect* solutions.

We build **modular systems**: flexible and scalable interfaces, composed of reusable elements.

We find ways to break the barrier between the responsibilities on an interface project.

We stimulate creative autonomy for developers and continuous participation for designers during the entire project.

We promote collaboration between clients, makers and users.

We want to foment discussions on digital interface creation and development on the communities that we participate.

We follow these principles:

### Ugly first

Every project begins "ugly", because we believe that the initial conversations should be about navigation flows and structure, not visual details.

### Gradual improvement

The project will be constantly evolving. Refinement will happen in agile cycles, prioritizing what generates the higher value. Expanding from smaller to biggger (*mobile-first* approach) and from the inside to the outsite (*content-first* approach).

### Look and feel over pixel perfection

Design guidelines serve as the project foundation, guiding the path for development. Therefore, interface decisions should be taken based on the final output – code in the browser –, not the graphic design tool.

### System-thinking, always

The interfaces will result from the combination of modular elements, built to maintain visual and functional consistency.
